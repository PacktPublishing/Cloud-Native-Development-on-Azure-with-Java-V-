# Cloud Native Development on Azure with Java [Video]
This is the code repository for [Cloud Native Development on Azure with Java]( ), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This course will help you architect a cloud-native application which will be resilient, can auto-scale automatically, and requires less maintenance; it focuses entirely on practicality, building a cloud-native application in Java and deploying it on Azure. Developers get hands-on experience in a range of computing, storage, data, and network services, which offers the developer a complete toolbox to build and deploy cloud-native applications. You'll learn about the driving factors for cloud adoption and see how cloud deployment with Azure is different from regular deployment on a standard data center. 
This course is a one-stop guide for Java developers who want to use Java Spring to build secure, resilient, robust, and scalable applications that are hosted on Microsoft Azure. You'll easily build and monitor a scalable, resilient, and robust cloud-native application that is always available and fault-tolerant.
